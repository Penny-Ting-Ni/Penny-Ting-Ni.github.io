      <h1>International Students & the Labor Market</h1>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
    <p>Today’s US labor market is highly competitive and suffers from a lack of transparency. International students
      seeking full time employment are at a further disadvantage in comparison to their domestic peers as they are
      subject to strict and circuitous foreign labor laws, visa constraints and a lack of information. While labor laws
      are at the discretion of regulatory bodies, there is an opportunity to meet the demand for information in the
      labor market available to international students.</p>
    <p>The application will present international students with information on the success rate an employer has in
      sponsoring foreign labor visas, how students can navigate through the regulatory constraints set by the Department
      of Labor and the skill sets that are in high demand in the US labor market.</p>
    <p>You can find the web application and try it <a
        href="https://penny-ni.shinyapps.io/Group13_project/?_ga=2.19052792.1733717315.1590099068-707621765.1587940826"><b>Here</b></a>

    <h2><b>Conceptual & Logical Design </b></h2>
    <p>Simplicity is at the core of the design in order to allow for clarity in content, robustness of data and
      performance of the application. The design combines the H1B data and corresponding employer data from the USCIS
      and Department of Labor websites.
      The following steps were taken to convert the raw CSV data into relational tables:
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <p>1. Explore the existing data and finalize the tables and attributes that are relevant to the app use case:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <p>2. Normalize the data in 1NF
      Extract information City, State, Zip code from Address data such as 8601 N Central Expy, Dallas, TX 75080 to
      City:Dallas, State:TX, Zip code:75080</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <p>3. Formulate new attributes , i.e. location latitude and longitude from the worksite</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <p>4. Create a new scheme and table structure once the basic design was ready</p>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <p>5. Clean the data before adding constraints:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removing some NULLs, partial / corrupted records</li>
      <li>Remove duplicate rows – used Common Table Expression for identifying the duplicates</li>
      <li>Keeping only H1B cases for which there is employer information</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <p>6. One to Many relationships:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>EMPLOYER contains information about the Employee</li>
      <li>H1b_Data contains information about the H1B case</li>
      <li>The one to many relationships were established by setting up the PK on Employer attribute of EMPLOYER, and
        foreign key employer_name on H1B_Data</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="card">
    <p>7. Added UPDATE and DELETE constraints on the foreign key relationship in order to support consistency of data
      between tables. Key elements of this included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removing any row from Employer table, results in a Cascade effect by removing rows corresponding Employer
        records from H1B_Data table</li>
      <li>Updating Employer name on Employer table, results in Cascading by updating the employer name on H1B_Data table
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>



  <div class="card">
    <h2><b>Shiny UI Design</b></h2>
    <p>The <b>Introduction tab </b>displays a dashboard of general statistics on the H1B employment visa. Features: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Total number of applications</li>
      <li>Number of Companies</li>
      <li>Approval Rating</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="assets/project/Database/1.png" class="center">
    <br>

    <p>The <b>Analytics tab</b> displays a table of employers and their successful H1B petitions, a bar chart to
      visualize the success rate and a filter to limit the number of companies and a map. Features: </p>
    <img src="assets/project/Database/2.png" class="center"><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Map: corresponding to the company name, job title, year entered on the Search Engine Tab, fetch the data and
        build the points on the map according to the latitude and longitude
        Show the relevant job title when clicked on the marked location.</li><br>
      <img src="assets/project/Database/3.png" class="center">
      <br>
      <li>Top Company: Top ‘X’ companies who filed H1B</li><br>
      <img src="assets/project/Database/4.png" class="center">
      <br>
      <li>Top Job: Top ‘X’ jobs for H1B</li><br>
      <img src="assets/project/Database/5.png" class="center">
      <br>
    </ul>
    <p>Under the <b>Setting (CRUD)</b> tab create, read, update and delete functions are built in. Features: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create(Insert query): Enter relevant details to fill EMPLOYER and H1B_DATA from the GUI Insert into EMPLOYER
        table first and then into H1B_DATA. Order of insertion is important as we have PK in EMPLOYER and FOREIGN Key
        Employer_name in H1B_DATA</li><br>
      <img src="assets/project/Database/6.png" class="center">
      <br>
      <li>Read(Select query): We use the select statements in number of features such as our Search tab, Map tab, Check
        delete and Check update and analytics tab for showing Number of successful applications,
        Number of companies, approval rating etc.</li><br>
      <li>Update (Update query): In case Employer name is changed, or Employer address.
        We have CASCADE update on Employer name</li><br>
